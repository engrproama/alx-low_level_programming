    -> This is the third project on C programming.
    
    -> They are compiled with the VI editor

    -> Compiled and uploaded through the Terminal.
    
    -> Used the Betty standard to check for errrors
    
    -> Passed the Betty style for code checking
    
    -> This task is focused on increasing your basic knowledge on Debugging.
